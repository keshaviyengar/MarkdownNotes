# 04 12 2020 Weekly Summary

### Summary of Week
* Cleaned up some training outputs (point clouds, models data) and have save intervals throughout
* Finished RL Bootcamp course [Deep RL Bootcamp course](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures)
* MATLAB visualizations
* Rough presentation outline
* 3 tube transfer learning failed, but because of a typo in env name. Currently finished simple model, start training transfer today

### Implementations
* MATLAB constant curvature model for visualization of backbone
* Trajectory animation for the squares, circles and triangles in MATLAB
* Point Cloud animation of improvement of point clouds through training
* New [ipcai2020 repo](https://github.com/keshaviyengar/ipcai2020) to track visualization code and data for replication later

### Experiments
* Strange transfer learning control for exact 3 tube, need to look into success rate and errors being so high so quickly.

### Ideas
* Using Kuntz coefficents for model based RL with negative rewards for collisiosn

### Lookahead
* Finish up animations
* Fill out powerpoint and write script
* Transfer learning experiment for 3 tube
* Investigate large success rate and low errors in control experiments for exact
